# Setting up this website using Ansible

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Overview

* Install Apache, MariaDB, PHP
* Download and extract latest WordPress
* Create and initialize database
* Create required pages
* Create Apache virtual host for the website
* Initialize Let's Encrypt certificate (TODO)

See file `hosts_example` for required settings.

A server can host multiple website instances. Simply use different `instance_name` and `domain`
values in each host file.

## Prerequisites

* Host must be reachable via SSH
  * `sudo apt install openssh-server`
  * Make sure that you can login via SSH from you machine
* Install Ansible locally (e.g. `sudo apt install ansible`)

## Steps for creating a new instance (first time setup)

### 1. Create a `hosts_myinstance` file from `hosts_example` and change values
* `instance_name` should only contain alphanumeric characters (no umlauts, special characters, spaces etc.)
* Change `domain` to the desired domain
* Change `domain_alias` in case the site shall be reachable under an alternate domain (WordPress will
  automatically forward this to the main domain, though). Multiple aliases may be comma separated (without spaces!).
* Change db user name
* Change admin user name, password, email

### 2. Execute `basic_setup.yml` once on this server (only needed for the first instance)
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance basic_setup.yml
```

### 3. DEPRECATED Setting up SMTP for outgoing emails (only once on the target machine)
This playbook installs msmtp and sets it as default mail transport agent for outgoing
emails on the target machine. The current setup only allows a single SMTP config
that will be used by all running WordPress instances.

Make sure to fill out the `email_...` variables in your hosts config file.

**Caution**: Some email providers only allow to send emails via SMTP if the from address matches
the admin address of the current WordPress instance.

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance setup_email_smtp.yml
```

### 4. Execute `setup_wordpress.yml` once on this server
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance setup_wordpress.yml
```
* Initializes the database for this instance and creates database user
* Downloads latest WordPress
* Creates Apache virtual host for the page, based on the domain
* Pulls and activate gruenes-brett theme and community-calendar plugin from Github
* Creates wp-config.php and sets all necessary settings
* Sets up SMTP configuration, if `email_address` is not empty (all other `email_*`
  fields should be filled out, too). SMTP is disabled if `email_address` is empty.
* Creates all necessary pages; removes unnecessary default pages
* Sets the permalink settings
* Sets up a cron job for nightly backups of the WordPress database of this instance.
  Target dir: `/var/www/gb_backups/<instance_name>/db_<timestamp>.sql`.
  Another cron job is created that deletes backups that are older than 7 days.

### 5. For initializing or renewing the Let's Encrypt certificate, execute
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance update_letsencrypt.yml
```

This is required if `http_prefix` is set to `https` in the host config file.

Normally this only has to be done once because the certbot automatically renews the certificate
when it's due.

### 6. Install Event Scraper service (only needed once for all instances)
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance install_eventscraper.yml
```

This creates a service at http://127.0.0.1:5050 that can be used for
scraping event data from Facebook.

### 7. Installing the landing page
A landing page, as implemented in the 'landing_page' folder of the gruenes-brett repo,
can be installed. This playbook will also try to install Let's Encrypt certificates
for all supplied domains.

1. In `group_vars/globals`, adjust the `landing_page_domain` and `landing_page_domain_alias`
   (the latter may be empty, or even a comma separated list of multiple domains without spaces).
2. Execute the playbook
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance setup_landing_page.yml
```

### Further manual setup steps
* Creating user accounts for contributors, authors and editors
* Fill empty pages with content

## Updating to the latest theme/plugin

Run this every time the theme and plugin should be updated to the latest version:
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance update_theme.yml
```
**Caution**: This will overwrite any manual changes that have been done to the theme or
plugin in the current instance!


## Updating to latest WordPress version
```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance update_wordpress.yml
```

## Removing a site

To remove a site, run the following playbook and confirm with Enter.

```
ansible-playbook -i hosts_myinstance remove_instance.yml
```

This deletes the page and the associated database. This cannot be undone!
